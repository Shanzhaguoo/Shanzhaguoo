## About ME
- I'm Guo Chen, a 3DV and Graphics Lover. 
- I am a first-year masterâ€™s student in Big Data at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University, advised by Prof. [Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/).
- I obtained my B.S. from Beijing Normal University, advised by Prof. [Shisheng Huang](https://shishenghuang.github.io/index/). I used to be a member of [IMCLab](https://vmcl.bnu.edu.cn/index.html) in BNU.
- I tried to turn pixels into voxels and caffeine into papers; when not exploring neural fields, Iâ€™m probably in a battle with my pillow.

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in 3D computer vision, with a focus on reconstructing and editing the 3D world and interactive 3D content for robotics and immersive applications.

- [NeuralIndicator: Implicit Surface Reconstruction from Neural Indicator Priors](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7ckuC9C2FZ)  
  ICML 2024 

## Skills
- Languages: Python, C/C++, Matlab
- Major: 3DGS, Reconstruction, Generation and so on.
