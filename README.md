# Hi there 👋
# Shanzhaguoo's Github Page

## About ME
- I'm Guo Chen, a 3DV and Graphics Lover. 
- I am a first-year master’s student at the School of Mathematical Sciences ([SMS](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/)), Peking University, advised by Prof. [Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/).
- I obtained my B.S. from Beijing Normal University, advised by Prof. [Shisheng Huang](https://shishenghuang.github.io/index/) and [Hua Huang](https://ai.bnu.edu.cn/xygk/szdw/zgj/194482e0996d4044806ac39019896e9c.htm). I used to be a member of [IMCLab](https://vmcl.bnu.edu.cn/index.html) in BNU.
- I tried to turn pixels into voxels and caffeine into papers; when not exploring neural fields, I’m probably in a battle with my pillow.

## Research
My research interests lie in 3D computer vision, with a focus on reconstructing and editing the 3D world and interactive 3D content for robotics and immersive applications.

  SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 
- [NeuralIndicator: Implicit Surface Reconstruction from Neural Indicator Priors](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7ckuC9C2FZ)  
  ICML 2024 

## Skills
- Languages: Python, C/C++, Matlab
- Major: 3DGS, Scene Understanding, Generation and so on.
